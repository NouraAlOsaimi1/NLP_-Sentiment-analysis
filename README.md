# Sentiment-Analysis Using Larege-BERT 
 we a fine-tuned BERT-large model for sentiment analysis. Ued a sentiment-labeled tweets dataset obtained from Kaggle.
 The original dataset contained multiple features, but for our purpose, we focused only on the essential ones(Text ,Sentiment) in order to reduce the model complexity and
 power wastage.
After fine-tuning and saving the model, we use a Streamlit interface to build a simple and 
interactive web app for inference. This allows users to input text directly into the browser 
and receive real-time sentiment predictions from the fine-tuned BERT-large model.
